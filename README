# The Arduino / RFID / Data Logger project  #
#############################################

This git repository contains the source code for my first Arduino project.

This project is aimed at creating a security / access system.  Access is granted (or denied) based upon the RFID wielded by the user. Every access attempt is being logged via a Data Logging Shield from Adafruit.  Also, who is granted access and who not is defined by data on the SD card of the Data Logging Shield.
