# The Arduino / RFID / Data Logger project  #
#############################################

This git repository contains the source code for my first Arduino project.

This project is aimed at creating a security / access system.  Access is granted (or denied) based upon the RFID wielded by the user. Every access attempt is being logged via a Data Logging Shield from Adafruit.  Also, who is granted access and who not is defined by data on the SD card of the Data Logging Shield.

Currently the software is split up in 2 separate sketches.  One for the RFID reading, checking and logging.  The other for managing the data that is contained on the SD card e.g. list all log files, show content of a log file, change the subscription information, ...

The reason why the code was split up is because having all this code in one sketch caused the arduino to grind to a halt.  Currently I'll continue on the data management part while at the same time trying to minimize the footprint of the rfid sketch.  An hopefully one they both parts of the software will reside back in one sketch.

Next to the sketches there is also a powerpoint of a presentation a gave about this project at 'newline'.  This was the event for the one year anniversary of the whitespace (www.0x20.be) hackerspace.
